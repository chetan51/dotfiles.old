Unfortunately that's all black boxed in libclang and as far as I know there's no api to figure out why it couldn't create the translation unit.\n\nMy only tip would be to create a freestanding minimal test application that does nothing but create a translation unit with the appropriate flags and step through libclang with a debugger to see what happens. You can use [this gist](https://gist.github.com/3686396) as a base."

In order to rebuild libcache, I had to turn off the i386 architecture in CMakeLists.txt, or else I got a big stack of undefined symbols.  That appears to be because my libstdc++ is built for x86_64 only - do you think if I manage to get more of the 32-bit stack working I might have better results?\n"
