    "body": "@Rip-Rip Commenting from the SublimeClang perspective, a lot of indexing code has already been written and is working. For example much of the code completion and goto definition/implementation functionality relies only on the sqlite database in the [astexperiment](https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeClang/commits/astexperiment) branch. So the original intent of the issue on the SublimeClang plugin isn't far from being complete (first 90% is done, just need to finish \"the other 90%\" (tm)).\r\n\r\nI'd argue though that a joined effort is quite a different perspective than the one I originally had when working on that code. While most of it isn't specific to the SublimeText 2 editor, it is all written in python and I think a joined project would do better to be pure C/C++ to be truly editor agnostic.\r\n\r\nSome functionality would also be lost in a common indexer (like preformatted strings ready to be displayed in Sublime Text 2's completion dialog without further processing).\r\n\r\nWhile I do think sharing efforts would make sense, I'm not sure I'm ready to sacrifice the code that's SublimeText 2 specific and rewriting it all in C/C++ isn't something I'm personally interested in right now. Maybe I'll change my mind if someone else gets the project started and I can see that that project suits my needs better than the code I currently have, but right now the path of least resistance seems to me to be to continue working on my code."
