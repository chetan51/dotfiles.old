I'm not going to investigate myself, but will leave this issue open if someone in the community has more information to add that might help. You might also want to try asking in the [Sublime Text 2 forums](http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/). If you do figure out how to get it to work, please let me know how so that I can update the instructions. Thanks"
