    "body": "Those settings and the error doesn't make any sense, are you sure that's the setting that was actually used when compiling the file? Try setting \"debug_options\" to true and it'll print the actual options used to the python console.\n\nAlso note that when changing the project file, it will only pick up the changed options for new files. The easiest way to apply those change is to just clear the cache (alt+d,alt+c). I should probably change this so that a recompile is done when it notices that the settings have changed. I'll open this up as a new issue.\n\nThe options override the defaults so just having your user path isn't enough, you'll likely want to copy and paste the base settings with tweaks to the actual paths that are on your system and then add your own includes to the end of the list. If you have Xcode 4 installed, the base path for developing for iOS is going to look something like [this](https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeClang/issues/52#issuecomment-5687212)."

    "body": "Okay.  So I finally got a chance to play around with it some more and do some actual work but I caught another snag.  It works fine in .m files.  But when I switched over to a .h file, I get the following error:\n\n    /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator5.1.sdk//System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/NSObjCRuntime.h\n\nAny ideas?\nActually, the output panel is something this error 20 times and then says: \"too many errors\""
