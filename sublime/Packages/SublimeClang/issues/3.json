    "body": "I spent the day compiling/debugging stuff and figuring the problem on windows X64. The function calling convention has been changed, but the `ctypes` module, binding python code to external libclang DLL is not up-to-date concerning this. One of the new rule requires that each function parameter passed by value of more than N(12?) bytes, has to be silently morphed into a reference/pointer. This is not happening on the python/ctypes side, but assumed on the libclang.dll side. \r\nActually libclang has many functions concerned by this (all those using CxCursor fe), and it's a sure crash when calling them.\r\nSome choices now: waiting for a better ctypes, begging for a better clang interface, proxying libclang with another dll more accessible to python... @quarnster, any opinion on this ? Will push my luck a bit with mingw and calling conventions flags in the meantime... Cheers."
