I might not be able to fix it in the next couple of days depending on how busy I am.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime there's no setting that I know of that would disable the plugin for specific files, but you could create a temporary plugin (menu item Tools->New Plugin) like the following though:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sublime, sublime_plugin\r\nimport os\r\n\r\nclass Temp(sublime_plugin.EventListener):\r\n    def on_activated(self, view):\r\n        fn = view.file_name()\r\n        problematic_files = [\"main.cpp\"]\r\n        if fn and os.path.split(fn)[1] in problematic_files:\r\n            print \"disabling SublimeClang for %s\" % fn\r\n            view.settings().set(\"sublimeclang_enabled\", False)\r\n```"
