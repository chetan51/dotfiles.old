The only time SublimeClang modifies the content of the buffer is when typing \".\", \">\", \":\", \" \" to insert that specific character and then show the completion list if enabled.\n\nI just tried to reproduce your issue with ST2 2211, but I couldn't. Typing \"(\" just inserts that character and closes the completion list for me without commiting the selected autocompletion.\n\nIf it's of any help, here are the relevant settings I have for autocompletion:\n\n```json\n\t\"auto_complete\": true,\n\t\"auto_complete_commit_on_tab\": true,\n\t\"auto_complete_delay\": 200,\n\t\"auto_complete_selector\": \"source - comment, string, meta.tag\",\n\t\"tab_completion\": true,\n```\n\nIf you are on ST2 >= 2211 and these settings do nothing for you, I can only recommend trying the forums again..."

While SublimeClang isn't responsible for committing the autocompletion, that it improves by removing the space key binding hints at that it's responsible for inappropriately showing the autocomplete window or taking the key binding that ST2 needs to dismiss the autocomplete window.\n\nI'll look into tweaking that.

The latter change makes for example \"this->variable->\" show the completions for \"variable->\" rather than \"this->\" again (as apparently triggering the complete command when the complete dialog is already showing doesn't query the available completions given the new data in the buffer, but rather just displays the same old completions again).\n\nI don't think there's anything else I can do for this bug, so closing."
