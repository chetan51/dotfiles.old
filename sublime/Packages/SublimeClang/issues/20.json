    "body": "Thanks, this fix has now been submitted. AFAIK a view becomes windowless when it's closed. Since parsing is done in a separate thread, you could end up with a situation where:\r\n\r\nYou edit the file\r\nYou save the file\r\n   Which kicks off a reparse of the file\r\nYou close the file\r\n   The file finishes compilation, but the view is now closed and thus windowless\r\n"
