    "body": "A lot of improvement regarding speedier completion has gone into the clangexp branch which will be merged into master at some point in the future when [issue 126](https://github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control/issues/126) in Package Control is fixed.\n\nFor anyone who have slow completions in your projects, I recommend checking out the clangexp branch manually for now. If something is broken in it, please let me know and also be aware that you can toggle the fast completions on and off with the default keybinding alt+d,alt+f and if nothing is found by the fast completions it'll fall back to the old libclang completions. So worst case you'll have to toggle fast completions off temporarily, and best case you get much faster completions. As a reference in one of my project it takes less than 13 ms for a simple class member completion that took 5.35 seconds (!) before, or ~0.5s vs 7.25s when just pressing ctrl+space on an empty line.\n\nHere are the steps needed to check out the clangexp branch:\n\n```\n# Uninstall SublimeClang via Package Control if you had it installed this way before\n# Go to your Packages directory in a terminal\ngit clone git://github.com/quarnster/SublimeClang.git\ncd SublimeClang\ngit checkout clangexp\ngit submodule update --init\n# There are now prebuilt versions for Windows x86/x64 and OS X x86/x64, but for Linux or if you want to build your own version:\ncd src\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake\n# If you are using Windows and are building with nmake you might have to copy the dll file manually with \"copy *.dll ..\\..\\\" \n# Restart sublime text\n# Hopefully you'll get as much of an improvement as I do.\n# Btw if you don't have cmake installed, the sources needing compilation is just a single .cpp file,\n# so you can probably just as well manually invoke the appropriate compiler command to generate\n# a shared library on your platform.\n```\n\nIt'll still fall back to libclang's completions for templates though. Once merged with master it'll have precompiled shared libraries for Win32/64 and OS X 32/64. Linux users will have to compile it themselves (but there's a pop up dialog telling you about that part if the lib isn't found).\n\nNot sure if anyone other that myself has tested the clangexp branch so it might suffer from issues I've not seen. But for anyone trying, please give me your feedback and open up issues where it's not behaving as expected.\n"

Nothing I use often anyway, direct member completion works perfect."
