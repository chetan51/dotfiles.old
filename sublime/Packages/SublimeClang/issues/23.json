    "body": "I also thought it was the best idea to take the project file as starting position for relative paths (if its outside your project you also won't check it in, losing the need for relative paths too).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure relative paths work in project files, but in case they don't we have to move (part) of the issue to sublime text itself. If it does and it contains relative paths you can work backwards to resolve any in the project-file mentioned directories back to the project file itself. However, this would fail when the project file contains absolute directories. (But then the same argument goes: no relative dirs in project -> not checked in -> no need for this feature too).\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think it might be best to get the project file path from Sublime itself. If it does no support that (in for example a variable) we might first have to ring a bell there."
