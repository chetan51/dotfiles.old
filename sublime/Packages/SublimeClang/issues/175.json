    "body": "Can you consistently make it happen at the same spot in your code? So if you typed \".\" and the hang happend, does it happen again if you erase the \".\" and then type it again?\r\n\r\nFirst order of things would be to enable [timing completions](https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeClang/blob/7c30b9ed2e932d2b65588bd9e4168a213dd6de12/SublimeClang.sublime-settings#L124) and see if you get a noticeable difference between [fast completions and slow completions](https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeClang/blob/804f519784be1640fee4079f158259d3de86d329/Default.sublime-keymap#L61). If the \"fast completions\" are much slower than the \"slow completions\", the previous bugs where this issue has been observed have all been related to regular expressions gone wild. I added a [debug flag to parsehelp/parsehelp.py](https://github.com/quarnster/parsehelp/blob/4600e3dd1ef148e98e8fcb8e2e59ff671d1592d8/parsehelp.py#L25), which if you set it to True will spit out the call stack and the precise timing of the functions. You have to restart ST2 for the debug setting to apply though."
