However, it uses the union of all the flags of all the sources inside the folder for any source or header file located in the same folder. This is maybe not optimal, as we loose the possibility to use the exact flags that are used to compile each source file.\n\nAlso it does not solve the issue of missing flags for headers located elsewhere, where no source file is located (for example in a separated include/ folder)."

    "body": "Well, CMake is able to generate such database. However the database format and mechanism is specified by Clang (see the link in the first comment). I even think the Clang developers are responsible for the CMake support, as Clang is built using it.\n\nBy the way, the database is currently parsed by the plugin, but it seems that the clang python bindings have a direct support for it since Clang 3.2. http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__COMPILATIONDB.html I haven't looked how to use this correctly.\n\nAnyway, as the implementation is not complete and has some obvious issues that I did not foresee, I would say this require some more work.\n\nThe script is maybe one better solution, and would simply parse the database, aggregating all the flags together... Although I liked the possibility to have the exact flags used to build each file (which could vary from file to file)."
