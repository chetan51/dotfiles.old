Now there are clang include files in here, and I diffed this with the standard clang include dir, and they are the same, so it must have been copied from there. Which is fine. \n\nI think the issue is there are spaces in the path there (\"Application Support\" and \"Sublime Text 2\" within the path) which causes problems as you can imagine... \n\nI'm also wondering why this needs to be done because the path to the clang include dir is in the default options later anyway!
