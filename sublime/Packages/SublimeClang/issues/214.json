    "body": "`alt+d,alt+s` corresponds to calling the external command `clang --analyze` while saving the file corresponds to a reparse request with `libclang`. There's no way way to invoke the analyzer from libclang (unless it was added in 3.2, I haven't looked closer) so a save operation is just to bring the internal translation unit representation up to date.\r\n\r\nI guess the plugin could be modified to optionally perform both tasks on a save, so I consider this a feature request."
