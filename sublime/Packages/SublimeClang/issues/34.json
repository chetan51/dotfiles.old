I'm probably not going to dig further since I didn't see anything obvious in the documentation, but feel free to ask Jon and let me know what he says.\r\n\r\nI do know how to check for an already hidden panel though, and that's what I've implemented in commit ded2aa18d71ef9bcbce41b952be845e954db656d.\r\n\r\nI actually have both options disabled and only manually show the panel (alt+d,alt+p) when I want it to show.\r\n"
