    "body": "I am able to reproduce the issue with a similar folder structure on Ubuntu 12.04. I'm using the latest versions of Sublime Text 2 and SublimeClang. I added both the source and header folder to the sublime-project file, but does not help.\n\nFor some cases it works though, as long as the implementation and the definition are on the same file,. However, that is hardly the case for typical h, cpp usage."

    "body": "If the implementation is outside of the translation unit it'll only guess as to where it might be, and currently only looks for a file with the name of the header but with extensions [\"cpp\", \"c\", \"cc\", \"m\", \"mm\"] in the same folder as the header is in.\n\nFor projects or folders opened in Sublime Text 2 there might be a way to get all the file names in the project (as used by the goto anything feature) so a smarter way to handle this would be to find a matching implementation file that way.\n\nI'm unlikely to do anything about this myself in the near term, but have a look in sublimeclang.py around [line 204](https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeClang/blob/master/sublimeclang.py#L204) to see what it's currently doing, and feel free to submit a pull request."
