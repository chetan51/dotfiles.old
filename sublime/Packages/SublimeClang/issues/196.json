    "body": "After doing some more research on sublime plugin api and the code of this plugin ( i've got 0 python experience) it seems like this is a sublime bug/limitation. I can't find any way for this plugin to know if a project load has begun and not yet finished. \r\nThus I can only see work-arounds as solutions to this problem. for instance a setting like wait_for_dummy_project_setting_to_load which would require all projects to have such a dummy setting, effectively making it opt-in for all projects. same result can be achieved using enabled : false as default and enabling per project.\r\n\r\nAnyone else got any ideas?
