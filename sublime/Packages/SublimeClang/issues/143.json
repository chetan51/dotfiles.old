    "body": "In putting together a reproducible project I've noticed another quirk.  The issue always happens on the same file in the example project (which I will be uploading soon) _and_ the issue only occurs when I try to tell SublimeClang to include (using the -I option in the settings) the large library located on my root directory (C:\\).\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by that last statement if I copy the entire Qt/4.7.1/include directory any into the project it appears to work in this test app; by work I mean Sublime Text 2 doesn't crash.\r\n\r\n(note that the .sublime-project file can be found in the uploaded project)\r\nIf in my .sublime-project file under Settings I add this\r\n```\r\n\"-IC:\\\\Qt\\\\4.7.1\\\\include\\\\QtCore\",        <---will cause Sublime to crash\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut with this\r\n```\r\n-I${folder:${project_path:hw.sublime-project}}\\\\Qt\\\\4.7.1\\\\include\\\\QtCore\"   <--- will _not_ crash\r\n```\r\nNow I do see this issue occur in another project that I'm not able to upload and I am not including a large library like Qt but rather just my own source/test files.  \r\n\r\nYou can find the project [here](http://github.com/kvb/sublime_ex).  Please not that there was no attempt to make it compile, this is used to illustrate only the Sublime Crash piece.\r\n\r\nPlease view the README file for a not about issue  #144.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "The build version 1.0.34 appears to address the vector increment error, however it does introduce a new one.  Whenever I do a `Project->Switch Project In Window` and select a project that has custom sublimeclang settings in the project file, Sublime crashes with the (Windows) message `Sublime Text 2 has stopped working`.  I'll continue to run with version 1.0.34 and see if the original issue  #143 appears again\r\n\r\n**Update:  I am starting to see more serious looking Sublime crashes.  I just edited my project file and did a _save_ and Sublime Crashed"
