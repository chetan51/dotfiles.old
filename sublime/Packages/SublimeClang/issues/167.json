Try to reproduce the bug, get a complete callstack into libclang itself and figure out what fixes are required on their side. Submit a bug report, chase up on the mailing list and submit a patch!\r\n\r\nIf you can't repro, I'll see if I can free up some time as I've been looking for an excuse to submit some patches to SublimeClang."
