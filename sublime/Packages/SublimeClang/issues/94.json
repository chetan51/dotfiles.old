    "body": "Interesting. According to sublime.log_commands(True), the \"next_result\" and \"prev_result\" commands are executed so the plugin does not override the key binding nor the command. The best I can do from plugin side is to not update the data in the error panel until  it is displayed, which is now done with 053495e. So if you update to the latest version and set \"show_output_panel\": false to prevent it from automatically popping up (you can toggle it with alt+d,alt+f when you need it), you can get the expected behavior of the next_result and prev_result commands.\n\nAs for when the error panel has been shown with errors and/or warnings in it you'll have to get Jon to modify the behavior of next_result/prev_result to actually only go to the next and previous *find* results specifically."
