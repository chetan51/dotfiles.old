    "body": "There's no code in SublimeClang for deleting any .so files, except for when you do \"make clean\", so it's likely package control that does this.\n\nNow you could argue that since there's no binary files for Linux shipped in the package, package control does the right thing by deleting these files to avoid cluttering your system.\n\nI'm on the fence on this one. Since I'm the author of the plugin I just work with the latest version from git rather than using package control and so wouldn't see this issue. What are you other Linux users doing to avoid this problem and what do you think the right solution should be?"

    "body": "Sorry for late answer. \n\nI think package control doesn't do make clean it does second thing you've said. Remove all files not included in package and you're right, this is very right thing to avoid cluttering my system.\n\nBtw, right solution I think is, to ship required files with package. It would be really nice :)\nAlso I want to learn that why there are no binary files for linux in package ? Is this about distros or ?\n\nOn the other hand I can go with, if the compiled files will not be deleted. Not a big deal. "
