Probably they can reside only in a separate daemon and ST2 and the daemon can communicate with standard basic types. It's a larger task though as this means a very clean separation between the ST2 api and the libclang api will have to be made, but I also think that will result in cleaner code. "

That's a moot point on Linux since you need to get the ctypes lib anyway at the moment and so would probably get the multiprocessing lib also in the same instance.\r\n\r\nIn any case I really like the separate daemon approach so will continue to investigate that. It would probably also get rid of the ctypes dependency as the native code bits wouldn't need to run in ST2's process and so would make installation easier on Linux."

    "body": "I haven't thought a lot about this but the short of it is that as it needs to run in a separate process, the dependency on Sublime Text 2 would have to be removed. It would also be nice then if as much of the functionality as possible was in the separate process so that it could be used by other editors.\r\n\r\nWhile doing some thinking about this some while back I stumbled upon this thread proposing something similar in the llvm mailing list http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/cfe-dev/2012-June/022028.html, but it looks like it hasn't moved since or maybe it has and is being worked on somewhere else. It might be worth asking on the llvm list to avoid duplicated effort."
