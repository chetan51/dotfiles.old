Also the callstack shows the crash happening in clang and while not a 100% indication that SublimeClang isn't to blame, at this point in time I'd like more concrete fingerpointing at something being wrong in SublimeClang specifically before accepting any work.

It occurred randomly while typing both times, and I couldn't say what was typing. And the project is not yet ready for open release so I'd have to nail it down with a simple example which I don't have time for right now. Sorry. Thanks for the quick reply anyway!"
