I'd presume that you should compile and install any external library dependencies as is common with C/C++ libraries to get it to work as the source distribution might not be set up with headers and libraries in the correct path until you do the required compilation and installation steps. As to how to do that you're left on your own unless someone else knows the details and can chime in."
