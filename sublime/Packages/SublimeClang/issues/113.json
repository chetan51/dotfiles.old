    "body": "Sure:\n\n1. CMD+shift+P. Type \"key user\" and select the \"Preferences: key bindings user\" option. This will open up your user keybindings file (or an empty one in case you have no customizations yet).\n2. Have a look at the default [sublimeclang keybindings](https://raw.github.com/quarnster/SublimeClang/master/Default.sublime-keymap) by selecting the menu option Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> SublimeClang -> Key Bindings - Default.\n3. Since the one you want to replace is the alt+e version, search for alt+e in the default file and copy the whole scope.\n4. Paste this scope into your user keybindings.\n5. Edit the keybinding to whatever you want. I'm going to use ctrl+alt+e in this example.\n6. If it was empty from before you'll have to wrap it in square brackets so in the end you get something like:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"command\": \"clang_next\",\n    \"context\": [{\"key\": \"clang_supported_language\"}],\n    \"keys\": [\"ctrl+alt+e\"]\n  }\n]\n```\n7. Save the file. Done.\n\nIf you're having problems, try setting sublime.log_input(True) to log all the input sublime gets and sublime.log_commands(True) to see what command is executed as a result of that input."
