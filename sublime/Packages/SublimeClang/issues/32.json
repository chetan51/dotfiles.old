    "body": "That would require:\r\n- Reparsing the file after . is pressed to have the translation unit up to date\r\n- Check what the cursor before . is\r\n- And then possibly replace with ->\r\n- And finally possibly do an autocomplete operation\r\n\r\nI think that's going to be very disruptive and won't implement this myself. If someone provides a patch and proves that I'm wrong I'd gladly accept it though."

    "body": "For issue #46 I've been looking at traversing the AST, and it doesn't seem like this would be too hard to implement with the caveat that the translation unit is NOT reparsed, so it might be out of date and thus this feature wouldn't work all the time. But for the instances where the outdated translation unit can be used it should be quite easy to fix this.\r\n\r\nI'll implement this once I have a better idea how I want to implement #46."
