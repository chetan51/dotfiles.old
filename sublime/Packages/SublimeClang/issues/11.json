    "body": "I agree on the usefulness of this and definitely plan on adding support. I looked into what it would take to get this in there some time ago and it looks like the api is not exposed via libclang and the python bindings, so it would require a little bit of effort to write new bindings to expose the api.\r\n\r\nNot sure when I'll have time to look more deeper into this, but if someone wants to work on this I'd be happy to merge a pull request."

    "body": "Good news and bad news.\r\n\r\nThe bad news is that it's currently [not possible](http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/cfe-dev/2012-January/019712.html) to use the analyzer with just libclang. So it's not a matter of just writing new bindings, but creating a new dynamic library to support the static analyzer directly in the plugin. I'm not willing to do this but would accept a patch if anyone's really determined to go that path.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that the \"clang\" compiler binary can spit out analyzer information in a plist format which is dead easy to parse from python. So if you've got the clang compiler installed I've now added some commits which will invoke the static analyzer using the clang binary and output the results into the python console. I intend to implement error markers support and a proper panel/view for the output when I get the chance, but this is a start. Invoke with \"alt+d,alt+s\" (current file only) or \"alt+d,alt+o\" (for the whole project).\r\n"
