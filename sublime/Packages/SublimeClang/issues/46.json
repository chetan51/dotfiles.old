    "body": "The code in the astexperiment branch kept growing into a beast and the indexing time could be several minutes, even with the code ported over to C/C++. I decided to perform a little experiment and it turns out that linearly scanning through the clang cursors is faster than doing lookups in the database. I should probably have started with that test ;)\r\n\r\nClosing this bug since it's not worth the effort of using a database for faster completions. I'll still work on getting faster completions just using the translation unit though and some of the code from the astexperiment branch will be merged to master eventually. The faster completions work will be done in another branch.\r\n\r\n"
