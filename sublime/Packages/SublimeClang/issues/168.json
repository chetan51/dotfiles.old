You can manually clear the cache via goto anything (search \"clear cache\") and change the [index_parse_options](https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeClang/blob/7c30b9ed2e932d2b65588bd9e4168a213dd6de12/SublimeClang.sublime-settings#L81) setting to something different as a first attack vector.\r\n\r\nBeyond that you'd have to investigate what the [libclang resource usage](http://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX__TRANSLATION__UNIT.html#gaacd1a1e9d83aaeec6b800e701b3a53f5) and the libcache resource usage is and see if anything seems broken.
