    "body": "You can turn the error panel off with \"show_output_panel\": false, (or in the project settings \"sublimeclang_show_output_panel\": false) and then manually trigger it with the default keybinding alt+d,alt+p. While the error markers can be turned off with \"show_visual_error_marks\": false, there's currently no keybinding to toggle the setting.\n\nSublime Text 2 itself supports per file settings and most of SublimeClang sends in the view so that it would make use of that per file settings. However managing peristant per file settings is beyond the scope of this plugin and is better suited for a separate plugin as it could be useful for other plugins too rather than just SublimeClang.\n\nI imagine a regex-key, settings-dictionary pair where files matching the regex pattern will set the settings specified in the dictionary when the EventListener's [on_load](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/api_reference.html#sublime_plugin.EventListener) is called. It would also have a command for setting a setting for the active view with a provided argument of the setting name and value to set (and whether to toggle booleans etc). Then you could create your own keybindings to toggle whatever setting you want. I think a plugin like that would be very simple for someone to create, but it is not something I'm interested in as part of SublimeClang specifically."

    "body": "Ok, cool. Thank you for the quick reply, as always. And for the incredibly useful plugins, too.\n\nI tried to make error highlighting show and hide only when the error panel is displayed. I could turn them on when the user activated the error panel show keyboard trigger, but I couldn't find a good way to turn them off when the panel wasn't shown. I mean, I can call erase_error_marks(), but I couldn't find a reliable way to trigger that when the panel disappeared."
