    "body": "Adding random print statements to translationunitcache.py's get_definition made me realize that whenever I'm searching for a definition, I'm simply placing the cursor at the end of the word I wish to search for, which winds up exiting the method early via the \"len(word_under_cursor) == 0)\" condition. For example, in the case above I'll place the cursor between \"foo\" and \"(bla)\", expecting a search for \"foo\", which will fail.\r\n\r\nIf I move the cursor into the word, the definition/implementation search works fine.\r\n\r\nIs this expected behavior? I thought this used to work, but perhaps I just changed my usage?"
