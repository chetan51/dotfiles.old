I reported that [a long time ago](http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4541), but didn't follow up on it.\n\nTo close the output panel, you can for now either click in it and then do alt+d, alt+p or hit escape.\n\nPlease clarify if this wasn't your issue. I'll ping the thread in the sublime text 2 forum."

I get a bunch of compile errors for the one .h file I open, but I have no idea how to rebuild / clean / whatever. I tried clang_analyze_project but that just caused a seemingly endless set of clang windows to come up and take focus with no output.\n"
