Another reasonable default behavior would be for SublimeClang to include NO code files from a project.  This would force users to always create a per-project settings file, which is annoying.  But it's logically coherent.\r\n\r\nWhat SublimeClang currently does is neither of these options.  It unpredictably includes SOME code files from a project, in a way that isn't obvious or consistent.  \r\n\r\nI would urge #1 or #2.\r\n\r\nIf you choose #2, I would ask you to make project-settings level settings _additive_ to per-user settings, rather than overwrite them.  This lessens the burden on users having to recreate _all_ their settings in every project they have. "

In my usage so far it seems that SublimeClang is (by default) only aware of the files at project's top level -- is that right?  Or at the same level as the .sublime-project file itself, wherever that is?  \r\n\r\nIf that's the case, I'm not sure that's the best option for a default, so i'd like to argue for other approaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
