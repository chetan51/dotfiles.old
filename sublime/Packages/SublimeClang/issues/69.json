    "body": "Sorry, I messed up and forgot to package the clang subdirectory in the sublime-package. Funny thing is I tried to install via package control, but I had previously added a dummy entry for SublimeClang so it was probably using that version instead of the real version.\n\nIn any case this has now been fixed. I think you should be able to do an cmd+shift+P and select Upgrade package and then SublimeClang and it'll install the new version, but I'm new to managing packages this way so maybe I'm wrong. The version to look out for that has this fixed is 1.0.2 so if you get anything else and upgrade package doesn't change the version, maybe you have to restart ST2 or by some other way make Package Control see that there's a new version available.\n\n\nPs. I saw your donation, and I thank you kindly for it!"
