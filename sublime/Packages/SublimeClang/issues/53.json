    "body": "In theory(tm) the event handler's \"on_close\" should be called when a view is closed and by default the translation unit is then removed. Maybe there's a bug in the unload code or there's a reference hanging around to the translation unit still which keeps it in memory or something.\r\n\r\nIt could also be that since I share one index with all translation units, it's the index (which is never closed) that is keeping memory around.\r\n\r\nI have pretty much not looked into memory usage at all, so there very well could be issues in SublimeClang that prevents memory from being freed up."

    "body": "Actually, seems like on_close isn't called for the views in a window when just closing the window rather than the individual views. AFAIK there's no api to listen for a window closing. While the plugin could poll all views currently open and remove the closed files from the cache, I think it's just easier to manually invoke a cache clearing with alt+d,alt+c at that point. I'll consider this bug blocked until the API in ST2 is fixed."
