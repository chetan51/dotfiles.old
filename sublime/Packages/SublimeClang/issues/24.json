    "body": "Sorry, I missed this in the forums. I'm not attached to the ctrl+d key binding so I've changed the defaults to alt+d. If anyone wants ctrl+d back they can just modify their user key bindings :)\r\n\r\nI grepped through the default settings and all the plugins I have installed and none of them seem to use alt+d, so hopefully there won't be any clashes. Closing the issue since this should be fixed now, please reopen if I've missed something.\r\n\r\nThanks"
