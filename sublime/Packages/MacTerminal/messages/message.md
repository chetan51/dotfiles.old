Open:
```
Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> Macterminal -> Settings - User
```

And set :
```
{
    "directory_mode" : "project"
}
```

Added support for iTerm 2. Just go to:

```
Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> Macterminal -> Settings - User

If you wish you can also change it in Settings - Default.

Full support for opening terminal from sidebar.
