# 26.10.2014 version 3.0.0

1. Complete rewrite of applescript to open terminals
2. In Yosemite macterminal is using javascript automation instead of applescript
3. Merged PR #30 - ixes behavior of no action when configured with directory_mode = project and sublime has not a project open

There still needs to be 1 second delay between activating the terminal and pushing command+t to open new tab
so please be patient. Remember also that if you switch windows when macterminal is working then it's going to fail.

1. Added Debug mode.
    When plugin is not working correctly you can turn on debug mode with ```'debug': true``` in settings.
    After that please use again plugin and send me log from sublime console (default shortcut is ``` ctrl+` ```).
    Just copy text between "---MacTerminal Debug Start---" and "---MacTerminal Debug End---" and paste it to issue.

2. Updated Terminal applescript.
    I found that Terminal can have problems with speed between commands so I've added small delays.
    Looks like it does the trick.

3. Updated links in packages.json to codeload.github.com

4. Added tags and updated packages.json to download code from tag.

5. Updated readmes.

# 23.03.2013

Added option to define ``` osascript ``` path because some of you may have problem with PATHs.
From now by path to ``` osascript ``` it's set to ``` /usr/bin/osascript ``` and can be changed in settings.
More info in [issue #8](https://github.com/afterdesign/MacTerminal/issues/8).

For more info how to setup ``` osascript ``` path just checkout [README.md](https://github.com/afterdesign/MacTerminal)

Added "Open in terminal" to command palette.
