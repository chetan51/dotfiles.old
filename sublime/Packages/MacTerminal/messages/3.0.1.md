# 29.10.2014 version 3.0.1

---

1. Add path quoting in python

---

1. Complete rewrite of applescript to open terminals
2. In Yosemite macterminal is using javascript automation instead of applescript
3. Merged PR #30 - ixes behavior of no action when configured with directory_mode = project and sublime has not a project open

There still needs to be 1 second delay between activating the terminal and pushing command+t to open new tab
so please be patient. Remember also that if you switch windows when macterminal is working then it's going to fail.
